Configure the campaign to provide a coupon code every time your customer abandons a cart, or protect yourself from your customers gaming the system and only deliver a coupon code every other or every third time.\r\nOrder Automation \r\nAutomatically start one or more Infusionsoft campaigns when a customer places an order\r\nSync Customers, Orders and Products \r\nAs your customers buy, Revenue Conduit automatically syncs all your customers, orders and products to the Infusionsoft CRM system.\r\nAssociate Tags to Products and Categories \r\nInfusionsoft uses Tags to segment customers based on what they bought, what they are interested in and how engaged they are.

Using data that Revenue Conduit calculates prior to syncing your customer after they place an order, your customers will be given a 1-5 rating for Order Recency, Order Frequency and Monetary.

The big ecommerce companies use it, and now you can, too!\r\nCampaign ROI Tracking \r\nAs part of our Marketing System, you can easily see how much revenue your campaigns generate and track your return on investment.
