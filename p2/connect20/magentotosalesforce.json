This extension also has the capability to transfer abandoned shopping carts from Magento to salesforce as opportunities which would allow your sales team to track the opportunity and convert to a sale. We also have a feature where once an opportunity is converted to a sale in salesforce, it can create an order in magento. Please contact us at 302-355-0449 for further details or email me directly at _mailto:info@thylaksoft.com, buyan@talktoaprogrammer.com for further information."
